 * The chicken squawk command, based on the MDC song "Chicken Squawk".          *
 * Command (c) 2021 DamieFC, Song (c) 1982 MDC                                  *
 * When I walk into the store                                                   *
 * They sell the chickens by the score                                          *
 * But eating dead birds just ain't for me                                      *
 * I don't eat roast beef or fish                                               *
 * Porky Pig is not my dish                                                     *
 * Just go ahead and let your chickens be                                       *
 * In chicken circles it's Adolph Perdue                                        *
 * Wants to feed featherless chicken to you                                     *
 * I don't take orders from Colonel Sanders                                     *
 * Do you?                                                                      *
 * I don't wanna eat no hens                                                    *
 * Not even every now or then                                                   *
 * Wanna let all the chickens be                                                *
 * Bawk, bawk, bawk...                                                          *
 * Swing to the east and swing to the west                                      *
 * Swing with the chickens you love best                                        *
 * Come on down and do the chicken squawk with me                               *
 * Wishing Daffy lots of luck                                                   *
 * Cause Elmer Fudd's a hunting duck                                            *
 * They're dreaming about their little fricassee                                *
 * And Bugs Bunny is a friend of mine                                           *
 * Eating him I'd feel like Frankenstein                                        *
 * Eating flesh seems pretty foul to me                                         *
 * So on Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve                                          *
 * Give them turkeys a reprieve                                                 *
 * Ain't no turkey got to die for me                                            *
 * Foghorn, Leghorn wrote to me                                                 *
 * Say's MDC's alright by me                                                    *
 * Cause we all learned to let our chickens free                                *
 * Bawk, bawk, bawk...                                                          *
 * Swing to the east and swing to the west                                      *
 * Swing with the chickens you love best                                        *
 * Come on down and do the chicken squawk with me                               *
 * Lordy Jesus this must be the end                                             *
 * They got us eating our cartoon friends                                       *
 * Emancipate those little chickadees                                           *
 * Swing to the east and swing to the west                                      *
 * Swing to the chicken you love best                                           *
 * Come and do the chicken squawk with me                                       *
